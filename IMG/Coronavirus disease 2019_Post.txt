Fuzzy: On 30 October 2020 WHO chief Tedros has warned that “to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects”. 
He has described the vast spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as “really concerning.” 
They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs – including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects. 
Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. 
Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings and other symptoms. 
Tedros has underlined that therefore herd immunity is “morally unconscionable and unfeasible”.[231]
