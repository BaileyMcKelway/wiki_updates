Fuzzy: Coronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections.[44] Their size is highly variable and generally is an average diameter of 120 nm. Extreme sizes are known from 50 to 200 nm in diameter.[45] The total molecular weight is on average 40,000 kDa. They are enclosed in an envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules.[46] The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.[47]

Fuzzy: The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer, in which the membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) structural proteins are anchored.[48] The ratio of E:S:M in the lipid bilayer is approximately 1:20:300.[49]  The E and M protein are the structural proteins that combined with the lipid bilayer shape the viral envelope and maintain its size.[50] S proteins are needed for interaction with the host cells. But human coronavirus NL63 is peculiar in that its M protein has the binding site for the host cell, and not its S protein.[51] The diameter of the envelope is 85 nm. The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a distinct pair of electron-dense shells (shells that are relatively opaque to the electron beam used to scan the virus particle).[52][50]

Fuzzy: A subset of coronaviruses (specifically the members of betacoronavirus subgroup A) also have a shorter spike-like surface protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE).[43] The HE proteins occur as homodimers composed of about 400 amino acid residues and are 40 to 50 kDa in size. They appear as tiny surface projections of 5 to 7 nm long embedded in between the spikes. They help in attachment to and detachment from the host cell.[56]

Fuzzy: A subset of coronaviruses (specifically the members of betacoronavirus subgroup A) also have a shorter spike-like surface protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE).[43] The HE proteins occur as homodimers composed of about 400 amino acid residues and are 40 to 50 kDa in size. They appear as tiny surface projections of 5 to 7 nm long embedded in between the spikes. They help in attachment to and detachment from the host cell.[56]

Fuzzy: Coronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections.[44] Their size is highly variable and generally is an average diameter of 120 nm. Extreme sizes are known from 50 to 200 nm in diameter.[45] The total molecular weight is on average 40,000 kDa.
