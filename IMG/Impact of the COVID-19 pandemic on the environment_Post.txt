Fuzzy: In Venice, shortly after quarantine began in March and April 2020, water in the canals cleared and experienced greater water flow.[40] The increase in water clarity was due to the settling of sediment that is disturbed by boat traffic and mentioned the decrease in air pollution along the waterways.[41]
