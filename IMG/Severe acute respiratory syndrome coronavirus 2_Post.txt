Fuzzy: A study by a team of researchers from the University of North Carolina found that the nasal cavity is seemingly the dominant initial site for infection with subsequent aspiration-mediated virus seeding into the lungs in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.[62] They found that there was an infection gradient from high in proximal towards low in distal pulmonary epithelial cultures, with a focal infection in ciliated cells and type 2 pneumocytes in the airway and alveolar regions respectively.[62]

Fuzzy: A metagenomics study published in 2019 had previously revealed that SARS-CoV, the strain of the virus that causes SARS, was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of Sunda pangolins.[87] On 7 February 2020, South China Agricultural University in Guangzhou announced that researchers discovered a pangolin sample with a particular coronavirus – a single nucleic acid sequence of the virus was "99% similar" to that of a protein-coding RNA of SARS-CoV-2.[88] The authors state that "the receptor-binding domain of the S protein [that binds to the cell surface receptor during infection] of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one amino acid difference."[89] Microbiologists and geneticists in Texas have independently found evidence of reassortment in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.[90] The majority of the viral RNA is related to a variation of bat coronaviruses.[91] The spike protein appears to be a notable exception, however, possibly acquired through a more recent recombination event with a pangolin coronavirus.[92]  SARS-CoV-2’s entire receptor binding motif appears to have been introduced through recombination from coronaviruses of pangolins.[93]  Such a recombination event may have been a critical step in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2’s capability to infect humans.[93] Recombination events have been key steps in the viral evolutionary process that lead to the emergence of new human diseases.[94] Structural analysis of the receptor binding domain (RBD) and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) complex[95] revealed key mutations on the RBD, such as F486 and N501, which form contacts with ACE2.[96] These residues are found in the pangolin coronavirus.[96]

Fuzzy: There are still a lot of questions about reinfection and long-term immunity.[67] It is not known how common reinfection is, but reports have indicated that it is occurring with variable severity.[67] The first reported case of reinfection was a 33-year-old man from Hong Kong who first tested positive on 26 March 2020, was discharged on 15 April 2020 after two negative tests, and tested positive again on 15 August 2020 (142 days later), which was confirmed by whole genome sequencing showing that the viral genomes between the episodes belong to different clades.[68] The findings had the implications that herd immunity may not eliminate the virus if reinfection is not an uncommon occurrence and that vaccines may not be able to provide lifelong protection against the virus.[68] Another case study described a 25-year-old man from Nevada, the United States who was tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on 18 April 2020 and on 5 June 2020 (separated by two negative tests), which was determined to be a reinfection by genomic analyses that showed that there was significant genetic differences each SARS-CoV-2 variant between infections.[69] The man's second infection was symptomatically more severe than the first infection, but the mechanisms that could account for this is not known.[69]
