Fuzzy: A nucleotide analog, remdesivir is an antiviral drug candidate originally developed to treat Ebola virus disease.[126] It is specifically an adenosine analog which inserts into viral RNA chains, causing premature breaking of the chains.[127] It is being studied as a possible post-infection treatment for COVID-19.[5] As of May 2020, there were nine Phase III trials on remdesivir across several countries.[1][85]
