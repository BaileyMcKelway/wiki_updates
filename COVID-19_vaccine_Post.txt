Different vaccines have different shipping and handling requirements. For example, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine BNT162 must be shipped and stored at {{Convert|-70|C|F|abbr=}}, must be used within five days of thawing, and has a minimum order of 975 doses, making it unlikely to be rolled out in settings other than large, well-equipped hospitals.
