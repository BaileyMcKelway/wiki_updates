FULLTEXT: <td class="diff-addedline"><div>Meat and poultry processing facilities are considered critical infrastructure workers, and CDC advises that they may be permitted to continue work following potential exposure to COVID-19, provided they remain asymptomatic and additional precautions are implemented to protect them and the community.  However, their work environments may contribute substantially to their potential exposures, as they often work close to one another on [[Assembly line|processing lines]] during prolonged work shifts.  For [[engineering controls]], CDC and OSHA recommend configuring communal work environments so that workers are spaced at least six feet apart including along processing lines, using physical barriers such as strip curtains or plexiglass to separate workers from each other, and ensuring adequate ventilation that minimizes air from fans blowing from one worker directly at another worker.  For [[administrative controls]], they recommend staggering workers' arrival, [[Break (work)|break]], and departure times, cohorting workers so they are always assigned to the same shifts with the same coworkers, encouraging single-file movement through the facility, avoiding [[Carpool|carpooling]] to and from work, and considering a program of screening workers before entry into the workplace and setting criteria for return to work of recovered workers and for exclusion of sick workers.  For [[personal protective equipment]], they recommend [[Face shield|face shields]] and considering allowing voluntary use of filtering facepiece respirators such as [[N95 mask|N95 masks]].  They also recommend wearing [[Cloth face mask|cloth face masks]] that should be replaced if they become wet, soiled, or otherwise visibly contaminated during the work shift, although cloth face masks are not considered to be personal protective equipment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;</div></td>

FULLTEXT: <td class="diff-addedline"><div>The [[hierarchy of hazard controls]] is a framework widely used in [[occupational safety and health]] to group hazard controls by effectiveness.  Where COVID-19 hazards cannot be [[Hazard elimination|eliminated]], the most effective controls are [[engineering controls]], followed by [[administrative controls]], and lastly [[personal protective equipment]].  Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.  Administrative controls are changes in work policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.  [[Personal protective equipment]] (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.  All types of PPE must be selected based upon the hazard to the worker, properly fitted as applicable (e.g., respirators), consistently and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced, as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|12–16}}<ins class="diffchange diffchange-inline">   Randomized controlled trials and simulation studies are needed to determine the most effective types of PPE for preventing the transmission of infectious diseases to healthcare workers.  There is low quality evidence that supports making improvements or modifications to personal protective equipment in order to help decrease contamination. Examples of modifications include adding tabs to masks or gloves to ease removal and designing protective gowns so that gloves are removed at the same time. In addition, there is weak evidence that the following PPE approaches or techniques may lead to reduced contamination and improved compliance with PPE protocols: Wearing double gloves, following specific doffing (removal) procedures such as those from the CDC, and providing people with spoken instructions while removing PPE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Personal Protective Equipment for Preventing Highly Infectious Diseases Due to Exposure to Contaminated Body Fluids in Healthcare Staff|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32293717/|last=Jh|first=Verbeek|last2=B|first2=Rajamaki|date=2020-04-15|website=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|language=en|pmid=32293717|access-date=2020-05-29|last3=S|first3=Ijaz|last4=R|first4=Sauni|last5=E|first5=Toomey|last6=B|first6=Blackwood|last7=C|first7=Tikka|last8=Jh|first8=Ruotsalainen|last9=Fs|first9=Kilinc Balci}}&lt;/ref&gt;</ins></div></td>
