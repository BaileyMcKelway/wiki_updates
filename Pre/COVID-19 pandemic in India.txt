FULLTEXT: <td class="diff-addedline"><div>The pandemic has left a severe impact on Indian economy, leading to a negative growth rate for the first time in decades. Nevertheless, the economy started to rebound after the lockdown was eased. Increased requirement for consumption had led the government and private firms to repurpose their factories and production lines for manufacturing of more hospital beds, PPE and ventilators. India emerged as the world's second largest manufacturer of PPE during the pandemic. The Union Government also launched a major [[Atmanirbhar Bharat|self-sufficiency campaign]] to substitute imported products with domestically produced counterparts, especially to replace goods imported from China. <ins class="diffchange diffchange-inline">&lt;ref name=":442"&gt;</ins>{{<ins class="diffchange diffchange-inline">Cite web|last1=Misra|first1=Udit</ins>|date=<ins class="diffchange diffchange-inline">13 May 2020|title=PM Modi's self-reliant India Mission economic package: Here is the fine print|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/narendra-modi-coronavirus-economic-package-india-self-reliance-6406939/|url-status=live|access-date=21 </ins>October 2020<ins class="diffchange diffchange-inline">|website=The Indian Express</ins>}}<ins class="diffchange diffchange-inline">&lt;/ref&gt;</ins></div></td>
