SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original [[SARS-CoV]]. It is thought to have an animal ([[Zoonosis|zoonotic]]) origin. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus ''[[Betacoronavirus]]'', in subgenus [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|''Sarbecovirus'']] (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole [[genome]] level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13). The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S).The M protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 98.6% similar to the M protein of bat SARS-CoV, maintains 98.2% homology with pangolin SARS-CoV, and has 90% homology with the M protein of SARS-CoV; whereas, the similarity is only 38% with the M protein of MERS-CoV. In silico analyses showed that the M protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a triple helix bundle, forms a single 3-transmembrane domain, and is homologous to the prokaryotic sugar transport protein SemiSWEET .

[[Genetics]] also plays an important role in the ability to fight off the disease. For instance, those that do not produce detectable [[type I interferon]]s or produce [[Autoantibody|auto-antibodies]] against these may get much sicker from COVID-19. [[Genetic screening]] is able to detect interferon effector genes.
