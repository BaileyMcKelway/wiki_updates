A [[phylogenetics]] study published in 2020 indicates that [[pangolin]]s are a reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses.<ref name="BMJ-Best-Practice" /> However, there is no direct evidence to link pangolins as an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 at this moment.<ref name="Ortiz-Prado2020" /> While there is scientific consensus that bats are the ultimate source of coronaviruses, the pangolin CoV is sister to both RaTG13 as well as SARS-CoV-2. Based on whole genome sequence similarity, a pangolin coronavirus candidate strain was found to be less similar than RaTG13, but more similar than other bat coronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name="CurrentOrigin" /> Therefore, based on [[maximum parsimony]], a specific population of bats is more likely to have directly transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to humans than a pangolin, while an evolutionary ancestor to bats was the source of general coronaviruses.<ref name="ForbesOrigin" />

Fuzzy: A phylogenetics study published in 2020 indicates that pangolins are a reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses.[85] However, there is no direct evidence to link pangolins as an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 at this moment.[86] While there is scientific consensus that bats are the ultimate source of coronaviruses, the pangolin CoV is sister to both RaTG13 as well as SARS-CoV-2. Based on whole genome sequence similarity, a pangolin coronavirus candidate strain was found to be less similar than RaTG13, but more similar than other bat coronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, based on maximum parsimony and current sample data, a specific population of bats is more likely to have directly transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to humans than a pangolin, while an evolutionary ancestor to bats was the source of general coronaviruses.[84]
