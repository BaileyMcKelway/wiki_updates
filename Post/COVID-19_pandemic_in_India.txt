Pandemic left a severe impact on Indian economy, leading to a negative growth rate for the first time in decades. Nevertheless, economy started to rebound after easing lockdown. Increased requirement for consumption had led India's government and private firms to repurpose their factories and production lines for more hospital beds, PPE and manufacturing of ventilators, and India emerged as world's second largest manufacturer of PPE. Government also launched a major [[Atmanirbhar Bharat|self-sufficiency campaign]] to substitute imported products with domestically produced counterparts especially to replace good imported from China.
