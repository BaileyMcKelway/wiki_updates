In March, after the lockdown was imposed, the United Nations (UN) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) praised India's response to the pandemic as 'comprehensive and robust', terming the lockdown restrictions as 'aggressive but vital' for containing the spread and building necessary healthcare infrastructure. At the same time, the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) noted the government's swift and stringent actions, emergency policy-making, emergency investment in health care, fiscal stimulus, and investment in vaccine and drug [[Research and development|R&D]] and gave India a score of 100 for the strict response. Also in March, [[Michael J. Ryan (doctor)|Michael Ryan]], chief executive director of the WHO's health emergencies programme noted that India had tremendous capacity to deal with the outbreak owing to its vast experience in eradicating [[smallpox]] and [[polio]]. In June, India was ranked 56th of 200 countries in COVID 19 safety assessment report by Deep Knowledge Group. Other commentators have raised concerns about the [[Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in India|economic fallout]] arising as a result of the pandemic and preventive restrictions. The lockdown was justified by the government and other agencies for being preemptive to prevent India from entering a higher stage which could make handling very difficult and cause even more losses thereafter.

The pandemic has left a severe impact on Indian economy, leading to a negative growth rate for the first time in decades. Nevertheless, the economy started to rebound after the lockdown was eased. Increased requirement for consumption had led the government and private firms to repurpose their factories and production lines for manufacturing of more hospital beds, PPE and ventilators. India emerged as the world's second largest manufacturer of PPE during the pandemic. The Union Government also launched a major [[Atmanirbhar Bharat|self-sufficiency campaign]] to substitute imported products with domestically produced counterparts, especially to replace goods imported from China.
