Coronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections. Their sizes are highly variable generally with an average diameter of 120 nm. Extreme sizes are known for 50 and 200 nm in diameter. The total molecular size can be 40,000 kDa in an average. They are enclosed in an envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules. The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.

Fuzzy: Coronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections.[44] Their size is highly variable and generally is an average diameter of 120 nm. Extreme sizes are known from 50 to 200 nm in diameter.[45] The total molecular weight is on average 40,000 kDa. They are enclosed in an envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules.[46] The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.[47]

The E proteins are minor structural proteins and highly variable in different species. There are only about 20 E proteins in a coronavirus. They are 8.4 to 12 kDa in size and are composed of 76 to 109 amino acids.<ref name=":21" /> They are integral proteins (i.e. embedded in the lipid layer) and have two domains namely transmembrane domain and extramembrane C-terminal domain. They are almost fully α-helical, with a single α-helical transmembrane domain, and forms pentameric (five-molecular) ion channels in lipid bilayers. They are responsible for virion assembly, intracellular trafficking and morphogenesis (budding).<ref name=":20" />

Inside the envelope, there is the [[Capsid|nucleocapsid]], which is formed from multiple copies of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are bound to the positive-sense single-stranded [[RNA]] genome in a continuous [[Bead|beads-on-a-string]] type conformation. N protein is a phosphoprotein of 43 to 50 kDa in size, and is divided into three conserved domains. The majority of the protein is made up by domains 1 and 2, which are typically rich in arginines and lysines. Domain 3 a short carboxy terminal end and has a net negative charge due to excess of acidic over basic amino acid residues.<ref name=":21" />

The scientific name ''Coronavirus'' was accepted as a genus name by the International Committee for the Nomenclature of Viruses (later renamed [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]]) in 1971. As the number of new species increased, the genus was split into four genera, namely ''[[Alphacoronavirus]]'', ''[[Betacoronavirus]]'', ''[[Deltacoronavirus]]'', and ''[[Gammacoronavirus]]'' in 2009. The common name coronavirus is used to refer to any member of the subfamily ''Orthocoronavirinae.'' As of 2020, 45 species are officially recognised.
