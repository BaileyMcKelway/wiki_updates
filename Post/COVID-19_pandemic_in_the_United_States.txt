''[[USA Today]]'' studied the aftermath of presidential election campaigning, often to large, unmasked, and often not socially distanced crowds. COVID-19 cases did not increase after Trump rallies in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] and [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. However, during the fall runup to the November election, Trump conducted several campaign events each week totaling 120,000 attendees over 9 weeks. At least five of those locales experienced increases including a 35% increase in coronavirus cases in the two weeks after Trump’s rally in [[Bemidji, Minnesota|Beltrami County, Minnesota]]. The Biden side preferred to not hold public rallies.
