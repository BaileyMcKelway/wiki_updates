Differences across occupations caused difference in the economic effects across groups. Certain jobs were less suitable for remote work, e.g. because they involve working with people closely or with particular materials.  Women tended to be affected more than men. The employment of immigrants in the U.S. declined more than for the native-born partly because the kinds of job immigrants held. Inequity in economic impact on workers in similar professions occurred when employees laid-off completely were awarded both State unemployment benefits and up to $600/week in federal pandemic assistance - which together could equal or exceed pre-layoff income - while peers reduced to part-time employment struggled, ineligible for either unemployment insurance compensation or the accompanying pandemic payments.
