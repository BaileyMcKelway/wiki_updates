For retail workers in food and [[Grocery store|grocery]] businesses, specific COVID-19 hazard controls for employees include encouraging [[Contactless payment|touchless payment]] options and minimizing handling of cash and credit cards, placing cash on the counter rather than passing it directly by hand, and routinely disinfecting frequently touched surfaces such as workstations, cash registers, payment terminals, door handles, tables, and countertops. Employers may place [[Sneeze guard|sneeze guards]] with a pass-through opening at the bottom of the barrier in checkout and customer service locations, use every other check-out lane, move the electronic payment terminal farther from the cashier, place visual cues such as floor decals to indicate where customers should stand during check out, provide remote shopping alternatives, and limit the maximum customer capacity at the door.

If a person becomes sick on an airplane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, designating one crew member to serve the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.  Cabin crew should wear disposable medical gloves when tending to a sick traveler or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.  Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a [[Biomedical waste|biohazard bag]], and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.

For commercial shipping, including [[cruise ship]]s and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include postponing travel when sick, and self-isolating and informing the onboard medical center immediately if one develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.

Meat and poultry processing facilities are considered critical infrastructure workers, and CDC advises that they may be permitted to continue work following potential exposure to COVID-19, provided they remain asymptomatic and additional precautions are implemented to protect them and the community.  However, their work environments may contribute substantially to their potential exposures, as they often work close to one another on [[Assembly line|processing lines]] during prolonged work shifts.  For [[engineering controls]], CDC and OSHA recommend configuring communal work environments so that workers are spaced at least six feet apart including along processing lines, using physical barriers such as strip curtains or plexiglass to separate workers from each other, and ensuring adequate ventilation that minimizes air from fans blowing from one worker directly at another worker.  For [[administrative controls]], they recommend staggering workers' arrival, [[Break (work)|break]], and departure times, cohorting workers so they are always assigned to the same shifts with the same coworkers, encouraging single-file movement through the facility, avoiding [[Carpool|carpooling]] to and from work, and considering a program of screening workers before entry into the workplace and setting criteria for return to work of recovered workers and for exclusion of sick workers.  For [[personal protective equipment]], they recommend [[Face shield|face shields]] and considering allowing voluntary use of filtering facepiece respirators such as [[N95 mask|N95 masks]].  They also recommend wearing [[Cloth face mask|cloth face masks]] that should be replaced if they become wet, soiled, or otherwise visibly contaminated during the work shift, although cloth face masks are not considered to be personal protective equipment.<ref name=":4" />

For schools and childcare facilities, CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of community spread.  When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, [[social distancing]] strategies can be implemented such as canceling [[field trip]]s, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as [[physical education]] or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between desks, staggering arrival and dismissal times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms.  When there is substantial transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school dismissals may be considered.

There are also [[Psychosocial hazard|psychosocial hazards]] arising from anxiety or stress from worries about contracting COVID-19, the illness or death of a relative or friend, changes in owrk patterns, and financial or interpersonal difficulties arising from the pandemic.  [[Social distancing]] measures may prevent typical coping mechanisms such as personal space or sharing problems with others.  Controls for these hazards include managers checking on workers to ask how they are, facilitating worker interactions, and formal services for employee assistance, coaching, or occupational health.

Often workplaces are settings where groups share many hours of the day indoors.  These are conditions that can facilitate the transmission of disease, but also control it through workplace practices and policies.  Identifying industries or particular jobs that have the highest potential exposure to a specific risk can help in the development of interventions to control or prevent the spread of diseases such as COVID-19.
